0,21 July 2023,LoveofLegacy,6," Beautiful film, but so preachy
","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

3,31 July 2023,ramair350,10," As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.
","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

","To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

","8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

","The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

","I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end.

","I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure.

","Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well.

","Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society.

","The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",/review/rw9221648/?ref_=tt_urv

Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting.

There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance.

Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue.

Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial.
